Toy Raytracer

![Example Render](https://github.com/Tnecniv/traycer/blob/master/example.png?raw=true "Example Render")

I wanted to get some more experience working with Haskell, so I challenged myself to a Christmas hackathon and wrote a [raytracer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)). A raytracer is a good project for working with a new language because it is complicated enough that you can fully explore a language's features without being too big of a commitment.

Right now the program is limited to Phong-shaded spheres with hard shadows, but if time permits, I will add reflective surfaces as well.
